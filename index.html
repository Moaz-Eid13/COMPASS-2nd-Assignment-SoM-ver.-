                A computational approach to 3-body problems where I discuss two topics:
                First, the difference between different numerical integrators and how does that affect the simulation.
                Second, how does a simple change in the initial conditions affect the final outcome (I used rebound here).

                In this section I compare how three different integrators (Forward Euler method, Runge-Kutta 2, and Velocity Verlet) 
                compare when tasked with simulating a system of 3-bodies called

                Figure 8
                </a>. 
                I also compare them with different step values (dt=0.1 and dt=0.001).

                <p>
                    First, we can see that the <strong>Velocity Verlet with dt = 0.001</strong> achieved the best accuracy of all simulations. 
                    It is the closest in values to the website reference.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    These integrators work differently and we can classify them under two criteria:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Symplectic?</li>
                    <li>What order?</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Euler's Forward Method</h3>
                <p>
                    As we compare the method's formula to the true full formula (Taylor series), we can see that Euler's drops the 
                    <span class="math">(Δt)²</span>, which means that it's first-order and its global error is 
                    <span class="math">O(Δt)</span>. But what does that even mean?
                </p>
                <p>
                    It means that for every decrease in the step the error decreases linearly too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, is it Symplectic? <strong>No it isn't</strong>, as it doesn't follow Hamiltonian mechanics, which makes it 
                    distort energy and angular momentum across time (either decaying or increasing energy out of nowhere) 
                    leading the simulation to collapse just after some time. (The planets drift away or crash).
                </p>

                <h3>Runge-Kutta 2nd Order (RK2)</h3>
                <p>
                    We can see that RK2 is second-order as it drops expressions after <span class="math">(Δt)²</span>, 
                    so that is its global error. It means that for every decrease in the step the error decreases 
                    quadratically instead, which greatly increases efficiency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    RK2 also isn't Symplectic, so it distorts energy just the same as Forward Euler but after much longer times.
                </p>

                <h3>Velocity Verlet</h3>
                <p>
                    It is second-order and Symplectic. This makes it the <strong>most efficient</strong> of the three integrators here.

                In this section I study how changing the initial condition of one of the planets in the

                affects the whole system. In each simulation I increase the x-coordinate of the first planet by 0.05 
                more than the previous simulation. But to make it easier I used the Rebound library which is mainly 
                used for n-body problems.

                <p>
                    Since 3-body problems are non-linear, a tiny change in the initial positions might induce 
                    drastic changes in the results. This small change in the position affects everything from 
                    force to angular momentum.
