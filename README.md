# COMPASS-2nd-Assignment-SoM-ver.-
A Computational physics project. A simulation of 3-body problem.
A computational approach to 3-body problems where I discuss two topics:
First, the difference between different numerical integrators and how does that affect the simulation.
second, how does a simple change in the initial conditions affect the final outcome (I used rebound here)
